# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Neural-Networks
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis plays a crucial role in treatment outcomes. This project uses a Neural Network to classify breast cancer cases by analyzing diagnostic features.

# Features
# Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values and outliers.
Normalization and scaling of features for neural network optimization.
Feature selection based on correlation analysis to improve model performance.

# Neural Network Architecture:
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) with fully connected layers.
Activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid).
Optimizers (Adam/SGD) and loss functions (Binary Cross-Entropy).

# Model Training and Validation:
Split data into training and test sets.
Train the neural network using backpropagation.
Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Visualizations:
Training and validation loss and accuracy curves.
Confusion matrix to analyze classification performance.
